# Hello-world
Tao's first test run on Git Hub: learning Git by hand on project
Tao is new to Git and he wants to learn how to use Git in his work effectively.
Git seems to be a really good version control software for Tao. 
I want to try second change and merge request. So I will be confidant about the merge concept.
